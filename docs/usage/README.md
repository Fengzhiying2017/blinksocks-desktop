# Usage

1. Download **blinksocks-desktop-[platform]-[arch]-[version].tar.gz** for your platform and architecture.
2. Decompress it to anywhere you can access to.
3. Double-Click **blinksocks-desktop.exe**(Windows), **blinksocks-desktop.app**(macOS), **blinksocks-desktop**(Linux).

## Notice

Although blinksocks-desktop is cross-platform, but there are still some differences you need to concern among platforms.

## Windows

All things should work well normally.

## macOS

Manage system settings requires **root** privilege, blinksocks-desktop will ask for credentials once you start
**blinksocks-desktop.app**, if credentials is invalid, it will fallback to manual mode.

## Linux

There is no system-wide approach to manage system proxy among different distributions. So **you must config them manually**.
